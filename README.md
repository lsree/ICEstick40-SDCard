# ICEstick40-SDCard
USB-SD Card interface using the Lattic ICEStick40 FPGA dev board. 

## Timeline
* Build SPI driver that makes LEDs blink - 2 Weeks
  * Linux SPI driver
  * Verilog code
* Build Linux driver with FPGA configured to pass-through signals - 1 month
* Build verilog code that will seperate SD Card commands from the data.
